Staff have good knowledge of the food they are serving and where it originates from . Opted for Donaire Taster Menu and food was stunning as was the wine we chose . Stunning vistas over Plaza Del Duque shopping area to sea beyond and would highly recommend this fine dining experience

It was a superb experience a we recommend this restaurant to all of you, who just wish to spend a lovely evening full of care and a brilliant food.

The food is out of this world and every plate is like a picture and tastes even better. The service is second to none and they make you feel absolutely pampered without being overbearing. Take the larger tasting menu if you like fish,it’s beautiful.Overall a fantastic night."
6,g662606,d14091847,r810581304,From the start when we were met at the hotel door to when th same person wished us good night we had the most wonderful experience in food and service. My wife and I enjoyed every minute of our evening both with wonderful food a attentive and professional service. With COVID we have not travelled far in the last couple of years but this reminded us of how good fine dining can be when it is done properly and was as good as any we have eaten all over the world 
7,g662606,d14091847,r796286907,"After much searching we settled on this restaurant for my 60th birthday. What a fabulous choice it turned out to be. We were greeted at the door politely and effectively and escorted to our table. Once seated we went for the full tasting menu. Absolutely superb food lovingly prepared by the chef and quite exquisite. From start to finish the tasting menu was beautifully prepared and perfectly presented, a lovely journey encompassing fine dining local cuisine and international food. I've never seen Venison offered here in Tenerife before and again it was prepared perfectly. All the staff were totally committed to our comfort and the attention was kind, warm, informative and nicely balanced personal with professional at the exact right mix.. My heartfelt thanks to everyone at Donaire who made my birthday such a special occasion.A real treat for those who appreciate quality dining .Richard & Dalia."

9,g662606,d14091847,r792821753,"Unlike the majority of the reviews here, I was somewhat underwhelmed by my meal here in December. Overall the ambience was lessened perhaps due to COVID and the lighting at our table wasn’t amazing. The food though was the redeeming factor that brought it up to a 4/5, it’s probably worth a visit if you like good food. But it was a little pricey for relatively poor ambience."

60,g796999,d15662340,r811512258,We were staying at the Corales suites and decided to try Starfish .A warm welcome awaited as well as excellent fresh fish . Choice was excellent A very nice meal indeed 
61,g796999,d15662340,r808681184,"Visited for dinner (September 2021) following recommendation from our own hotel and so pleased we did. Lovely setting overlooking La Caleta. The food was superb right from the bread and seaweed butter and the delightful Amuse Bouche. We both had Seabass fillets and chose the sliced potatoes, charcoal peppers and green salad from the sides. The Seabass was up there with the nicest I have had - the meat was so moist but the skin so deliciously crispy and the sides were all delicious too. The staff were all so friendly and helpful. Excellent value and a really lovely evening."
62,g796999,d15662340,r802777922,"5 star service, Michelle’s star quality, our waiter Hugo was amazing, attentive, knowledgeable and helpful in getting the right table for us on the 3 times we have dined here. The lobster is amazing so is the steak and even things like the Galicia Burger…… all cooked in the Josper!Excellent wine selection and tasty local cheeses you cannot go wrong here. Great selection of seafood and meats with the usual fare for kids, pizza, burger, chicken etc Book or be disappointed!"
63,g796999,d15662340,r785609648,We went to starfish twice for Lunch and it was amazing! Food was excellent and the staff very nice. Will go back for sure!
64,g796999,d15662340,r785509100,"Staff was very helpful. The restaurant is at a very high level, but they have also the menu for smaller children. Thank you very much for a pleasant 14 days and we look forward to coming back again."
65,g796999,d15662340,r785480777,"Went to restaurant with family on holiday and had no good experience. We sat next to busy pool with many loud children playing besides us. The menu is not very inspired and local restaurant serve better fish. The service was very bad for us. We had to wait a long time to order and a longer time for our food to come. Staff was rude about it, manager apologized but do nothing. Maybe nice for tourist, not for fish lover."
66,g796999,d15662340,r784857423,"With an occupancy of 8 tables and 4 waiters, we were very poorly served. Our glasses were continiously empty and only refilled upon request throughout the entire evening. After waiting for almost 30 minutes to order our mains, we received a severely undercooked fish. The manager was so kind to pro-actively discount the mains from the bill, but after sharing our further observations he simply walked off in a frenzy. "
67,g796999,d15662340,r782926071,Seafood restaurant inside the Royal Corales hotel. Nice service but overpriced dishes which are quite ordinary. Convenient if you stay in the hotel though 
68,g796999,d15662340,r782703009,"Good produce but i think the chef didnt do justice to this produce. I sent back the steak to get it cooked right and when i got it back the second time it was overdone, fresh local fish cooked on the dry side what a shame, chewy octopus, lacking seasoning in all the dishes, uninspiring desserts... maybe a one off day. We are not the kind of people who likes to make a fuss and complain so we kept quiet. It wasn't that bad really but I expected more from this kind of establishment considering it was a fairly quiet night and the bill we paid. Fantastic location and correct service."
69,g796999,d15662340,r779951971,"Per se the food was quite nice, for example, the anchovies as a starter and tuna steak for main (black small potatoes were especially nice). Although the medium cooked steak appeared rather well done. However the cheese plate was a real disappointment. The restaurant was quite packed and loud. The service was also just average."

The food was superb right from the bread and seaweed butter and the delightful Amuse Bouche. We both had Seabass fillets and chose the sliced potatoes, charcoal peppers and green salad from the sides. The Seabass was up there with the nicest I have had - the meat was so moist but the skin so deliciously crispy and the sides were all delicious too. The staff were all so friendly and helpful. Excellent value and a really lovely evening."

The lobster is amazing so is the steak and even things like the Galicia Burger…… all cooked in the Josper!Excellent wine selection and tasty local cheeses you cannot go wrong here.
