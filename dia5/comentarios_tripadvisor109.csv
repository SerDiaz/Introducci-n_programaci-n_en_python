0,g662606,d14091847,r778259474,Had a bit of trouble finding a good fine dining restaurant open in Tenerife with COVID and without having to travel to the north. Ended up finding this gem and ate here several times during our stay. Restaurants food is well above the standard of surrounding eateries and while not to the standard of great restaurants in capital cities it is a great choice if you want a fine dining experience while on holidays. The wine list is a little sparse but had some good quality Spanish wines on it. The eel dish was superb and the truffled egg was well done. 
1,g662606,d14091847,r777019148,"Wow - what a fantastic restaurant. From start to finish, the service and the food was excellent. We went for the 5 course a la Carte menu which was absolutely delicious and really good value. We started with 3 types of bread and 4 yummy butters and then 2 amuse Bouche. After tasting the first course (mine was an egg truffle starter) we regretted not going for the tasting menu as we knew the rest of the meal was going to be great. We loved the squid which was fried at the table, as well as the Iberian pork shoulder. I also loved the beautiful plates and cutlery which were bespoke to every meal / course. Finally at the end of the evening, the chef came to meet us and say thank you which was a really nice touch. Would thoroughly recommend!"

The pick for me being the squid.Mains followed with cod (which we both had) which was lovely and fell apart on the fork. I also had veal cheeks which was extremely tender.Desserts of donaire garden and Duke rounded off a simply amazing meal. There was also a little glass tree of desserts brought gratis to the table containing sweet nibbles.Simply amazing. I hope this place survives the pandemic and can thrive on the other side. "

Le maitre and rest of staff understand very well the requirements and service expected for such a place. Excellent explanation on food and wine suggestions. We took the extensive 9 course menu and .... it was more than worth it. The chef understands very well how to use fine canary products to bring them to a modern culinary and up to date high level. Combining products, spices to visually very attractive presentations seem to be no effort at all.Been to many restaurants all over the globe, but this one found a high place in my ranking.If you would ask me to be very critical my personal advice would be to pronounce the spicing a bit more. But that is me only being very critical.Bart and Nadine"
6,g662606,d14091847,r768346838,"Excellent meal and beautiful restaurant, with a few extra treats to make the experience even more special for our anniversary. We had 5 courses from the a la carte menu, they were all fantastic! If anything, maybe too much food as we were not expecting the lovely selection of appetizers and petit fours. The service was brilliant, the glass was never empty, assistance at your seat every time you returned to the table, fresh napkins - it was all very professional and attentive. The price was very reasonable for a fine dining menu and experience, the equivalent in London would cost 3–4x more! If you’re looking for an exquisite dining experience, go here, I highly recommend it. The hotel also has a sky bar, we arrived slightly early and had a drink before our meal to take in the fantastic views. "

50,g796999,d15662340,r778113759,we decided to try Starfish for lunch and enjoyed our overall experience . our waiter was excellent food was very nice . freshly grilled fish was excellent as was the wine . it was a great start to our holiday
51,g796999,d15662340,r777826933,"We have been coming to Tenerife for 6 years, stayed twice at Corales Suites and have tried countless restaurants in the island. By far Starfish is a must! Dani and his team will make the meal unbelievable. combining seasonal fresh specialities and off the menu specials means we have not once left without a great meal and a big smile. Definitely worth mentioning the chefs Victor and Samuel whose seafood and lamb are to die for and all the team that will make you feel at home. Kudos "
52,g796999,d15662340,r776488827,"Starfish is located in the glossy Corales Suites Hotel & has a nice al fresco setting around the pool, overlooking the ocean. Decor is fresh & modern & there’s an easy going, laid back feel. Service was tip top, & prices reasonable. Sadly, food was rather underwhelming, overcooked & uninspiring."
53,g796999,d15662340,r769415363,"Stunning place! We had an exceptional time spending my partners birthday at Starfish, lovely food, beautiful views and great host Daniel. Thank you and we will be back"
54,g796999,d15662340,r769345021,"My wife and I stayed in Royal Hideway Corales Suites in Sept 2020 for 3 nights. We had our eye on the Starfish restaurant located within the resort since we arrived. I checked TripAdvisor and was a bit concerned to see a couple of recent negative reviews but we decided to go in with an open mind. We're really glad that we did as it was a lovely meal.Having been to the Starfish pool bar a few times before on previous visits, we already knew that they have a great selection of cocktails and their 'Creamy Prawns in Batter' are amazing and definitely a must-have! We have had them a few times at the pool bar in the past as a snack and both went for them as a starter.The menu is a tad confusing regarding the main courses. I ordered the T-bone steak, but the waiter informed me that it's only for 2 people. If this is the case, why doesn't it say on the menu? He also mentioned the Tomahawk, Entrecôte and Iberian Presa are sharing main courses. I feel this should be made more clear on the menu as it limits your choices if you want to order a different main from your dining partner. In the end, we both went for the Beef Tenderloin. It was a very nice dish. A quality steak with great sides (really recommend the sweet potato mash). I would say for our requested medium, the steak was perhaps slightly underdone but we don't mind it being on the rare side anyway so this wasn't a problem. I'll be honest and say it's not the best steak I've ever had, but still very enjoyable.The desserts were really nice. I went for the French toast with white chocolate custard and my wife had the Canarian Quesillo. Both very tasty.The location of the restaurant is fantastic. We had a great view of the sunset. The service was impeccable throughout the evening and very friendly. For some reason, the restaurant requests men wear long trousers however, someone in a table across from us was wearing shorts so it must not be greatly enforced. Given the outdoor setting, I'm not really sure why trousers are requested anyway. It seems a bit unnecessary.The restaurant is very reasonably priced for a 5 star hotel's eatery. Our bill was €145 which is pretty good considering we had 3 courses and a cocktail each. Overall we were really impressed with Starfish and would happily recommend it."

The place has all the ingredients needed to be a great restaurant such as views to die for, yummy cocktails and decent service, however I found the food a bit underwhelming. Our starters lacked seasoning, the steak wasn't top notch as I would expect for the price we paid and was a bit overcooked for what we ordered. The tuna was more on the blue side than medium rare and the side of chips was soggy. In my opinion a great place to chill with a cocktail and enjoy the views but there are much better places to eat in La Caleta."

We're really glad that we did as it was a lovely meal.Having been to the Starfish pool bar a few times before on previous visits, we already knew that they have a great selection of cocktails and their 'Creamy Prawns in Batter' are amazing and definitely a must-have! We have had them a few times at the pool bar in the past as a snack and both went for them as a starter.The menu is a tad confusing regarding the main courses. I ordered the T-bone steak, but the waiter informed me that it's only for 2 people. If this is the case, why doesn't it say on the menu? He also mentioned the Tomahawk, Entrecôte and Iberian Presa are sharing main courses. I feel this should be made more clear on the menu as it limits your choices if you want to order a different main from your dining partner. In the end, we both went for the Beef Tenderloin. It was a very nice dish. A quality steak with great sides (really recommend the sweet potato mash). I would say for our requested medium, the steak was perhaps slightly underdone but we don't mind it being on the rare side anyway so this wasn't a problem. I'll be honest and say it's not the best steak I've ever had, but still very enjoyable.The desserts were really nice.

We will be returning to this hotel in the near future (see separate review of the hotel) and look forward to meeting Daniel and his team again then. We wish them well through the current crisis - they deserve it. Highly recommended."
